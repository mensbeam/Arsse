General upgrade notes
=====================

When upgrading between any two versions of The Arsse, the following are 
usually prudent:

- Back up your database
- Check for any changes to sample Web server configuration
- Check for any changes to sample systemd unit or other init files
- If installing from source, update dependencies with:
  `composer install -o --no-dev`


Upgrading from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0
===============================

- The database schema has changed from rev6 to rev7; if upgrading the database
  manually, apply the 6.sql file
- This schema change is particularly invasive; performing a database backup
  prior to upgrading is highly recommended


Upgrading from 0.10.6 to 0.11.0
===============================

- Web server configuration has changed to accommodate new Nextcloud
  functionality which replaces deprecated Nextcloud News functionality; the
  following URL paths are affected:
    - /ocs/v1.php/
  You may need to restart your Web server for changes to take effect


Upgrading from 0.10.4 to 0.10.5
===============================

- PHP 7.3 is now required
- Web server configuration in the Arch Linux package has been modified to ease
  the use of alternative PHP interpreters; please review the sample
  configuration files for changes


Upgrading from 0.8.5 to 0.9.0
=============================

- The database schema has changed from rev6 to rev7; if upgrading the database
  manually, apply the 6.sql file
- Web server configuration has changed to accommodate Miniflux; the following
  URL paths are affected:
    - /v1/
    - /version
    - /healthcheck
  You may need to restart your Web server for changes to take effect
- Icons for existing feeds in Miniflux and Fever will only appear once the
  feeds in question have been fetched and parsed after upgrade. This may take
  some time to occur depending on how often the feed is updated
- An administrator account is now required to refresh feeds via the 
  Nextcloud News protocol


Upgrading from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5
=============================

- The sample configuration for Nginx has changed, to correct the omission of
  the QUERY_STRING FastCGI parameter in those passed to PHP. The omission
  affects the Fever protocol in particular (the parameter is required for 
  Fever to function at all), though it could potentially affect some
  Nextcloud News clients as well
