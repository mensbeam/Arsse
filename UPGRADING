General upgrade notes
=====================

When upgrading between any two versions of The Arsse, the following are 
usually prudent:

- Back up your database
- Check for any changes to sample Web server configuration
- Check for any changes to sample systemd unit or other init files
- If installing from source, update dependencies with:
  `composer install -o --no-dev`
