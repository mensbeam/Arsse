The Advanced RSS Environment (affectionately called "The Arsse") is a news aggregator server which implements multiple synchronization protocols. Unlike most other aggregator servers, The Arsse does not include a Web front-end (though one is planned as a separate project), and it relies on [existing protocols](Supported_Protocols) to maximize compatibility with [existing clients](Compatible_Clients). Supported protocols are:

- NextCloud News
- Tiny Tiny RSS
- Fever

At present the software should be considered in an "alpha" state: many features one would expect from other similar software have yet to be implemented. Areas of future work include:

- Providing more sync protocols (Google Reader, others)
- Better packaging and configuration samples
