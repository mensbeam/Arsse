The Microsub protocol is a facet of the [IndieWeb movement](https://indieweb.org/), and unlike other protocols is designed as a first-class interface between news-reading clients and servers.

As IndieWeb technology is sprawling and complex, The Arsse only implements enough so that Microsub clients can be used with The Arsse. Consequently The Arsse does not function as a generic IndieAuth authorizer, will not work with arbitrary IndieWeb identifier URLs, does not implement any Micropub functionality, and so on.
