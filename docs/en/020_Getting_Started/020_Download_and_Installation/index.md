# Installing from a package manager

We currently provide a few pre-built installation packages for the following operating systems:

- [Arch Linux and derivatives](On_Arch_Linux)
- [Debian and derivatives](On_Debian_and_Derivatives)

These packages significantly simplify installation, though a bit of manual effort may still be required. Updating The Arsse using these packages should require no manual intervention.

# Installing manually

For other systems The Arsse must currently be installed manually. As each operating system is different, we can only provide very general instructions:

- [Installing on other systems](On_Other_Systems)

We hope to support more operating systems in the future.
