.
.Sh COMMANDS
.
.Ss Managing users and metadata
.Bl -tag
.It Nm "user" Op Nm list
Displays a simple list of user names with one entry per line
.It Nm "user add" Ar username Oo Ar password Oc Oo Fl Fl admin Oc
Adds a new user to the database with the specified username and password.
If
.Ar password
is omitted a random password will be generated and printed.
.Pp
The 
.Fl Fl admin
flag may be used to mark the user as an administrator.
This has no meaning within the context of The Arsse as a whole,
but it is used control access to certain features in the Miniflux and Nextcloud News protocols. 
.It Nm "user remove" Ar username
Immediately removes a user from the database.
All associated data (folders, subscriptions, etc.) are also removed.
.It Nm "user show" Ar username
Displays a table of metadata properties and their assigned values for 
.Ar username Ns No .
These properties are primarily used by the Miniflux protocol.
Consult the section
.Sx USER METADATA
for details.
.It Nm "user set" Ar username Ar property Ar value
Sets a metadata property for a user.
These properties are primarily used by the Miniflux protocol.
Consult the section
.Sx USER METADATA
for details.
.It Nm "user unset" Ar username Ar property
Clears a metadata property for a user.
The property is thereafter set to its default value, which is protocol-dependent.
.El
.
.Ss Managing passwords and authentication tokens
.Bl -tag
.It Nm "user set\-pass" Ar username Oo Ar password Oc Oo Fl Fl fever Oc
Changes a user's password to the specified value.
If no password is specified, a random password will be generated and printed.
.Pp
The 
.Fl Fl fever
option sets a user's Fever protocol password instead of their general password.
As the Fever protocol requires that passwords be stored insecurely,
users do not have Fever passwords by default, and logging in to the Fever protocol is disabled until a suitable password is set.
It is highly recommended that a user's Fever password be different from their general password.
.It Nm "user unset\-pass" Ar username Oo Fl Fl fever Oc
Unsets a user's password, effectively disabling their account.
As with password setting, the
.Fl Fl fever
option may be used to operate on a user's Fever password instead of their general password.
.It Nm "user auth" Ar username Ar password Oo Fl Fl fever Oc
Tests logging a user in.
This only checks that the user's password is correctly recognized;
it has no side effects.
.Pp
The 
.Fl Fl fever
option may be used to test the user's Fever protocol password, if any.
.It Nm "token list" Ar username
Displays a user's authentication tokens in a simple tabular format.
These tokens act as an alternative means of authentication for the Miniflux protocol and may be required by some clients.
They do not expire.
.It Nm "token create" Ar username Oo Ar label Oc
Creates a new random login token and prints it.
These tokens act as an alternative means of authentication for the Miniflux protocol and may be required by some clients.
An optional 
.Ar label
may be specified to give the token a meaningful name.
.It Nm "token revoke" Ar username Oo Ar token Oc
Deletes the specified
.Ar token
from the database.
The token itself must be supplied, not its label.
If it is omitted all tokens for
.Ar username
are revoked.
.El
.
.Ss Importing and exporting data
.Bl -tag
.It Nm "import" Ar username Oo Ar file Oc Oo Fl r | Fl Fl replace Oc Oo Fl f | Fl Fl flat Oc
Imports the newsfeeds, folders, and tags found in the OPML formatted
.Ar file
into the account of the specified user.
If no file is specified, data is instead read from standard input.
Import operations are atomic:
if any of the newsfeeds listed in the input cannot be retrieved, the entire import operation will fail.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl replace
(or
.Fl r Ns
) option interprets the OPML file as the list of 
.Em all
desired newsfeeds, folders and tags, performing any deletion or moving of existing entries which do not appear in the flle.
If this option is not specified, the file is assumed to list desired
.Em additions only Ns No .
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl flat
(or
.Fl f Ns
) option can be used to ignore any folder structures in the file, importing any newsfeeds directly into the root folder.
Combining this with the
.Fl Fl replace
option is possible.
.It Nm "export" Ar username Oo Ar file Oc Oo Fl f | Fl Fl flat Oc
Exports a user's newsfeeds, folders, and tags to the OPML file specified by
.Ar file Ns
, or standard output if no file is specified.
Note that due to a limitation of the OPML format, any commas present in tag names will not be retained in the export.
.Pp
The 
.Fl Fl flat
(or 
.Fl f Ns
) option can be used to omit folders from the export.
Some OPML implementations may not support folders, or arbitrary nesting;
this option may be used when planning to import into such software.
.El
.
.
.Sh ADDITIONAL COMMANDS
.Bl -tag
.It Nm "daemon" Oo Fl Fl fork Ns = Ns Ar pidfile Oc
Starts the newsfeed fetching service.
Normally this command is only invoked by systemd.
.Pp
The 
.Fl Fl fork
option executes an "old-style" fork-then-terminate daemon rather than a "new-style" non-terminating daemon.
This option should only be employed if using a System V-style init daemon on POSIX systems;
normally systemd is used. When using this option the daemon will write its process identifier to
.Ar pidfile
after forking.
.It Nm "feed refresh\-all"
Performs a one-time fetch of all stale feeds.
This command can be used as the basis of a
.Nm cron
job to keep newsfeeds up-to-date.
.It Nm "feed refresh" Ar n
Performs a one-time fetch of the feed (not subscription) identified by integer
.Ar n Ns No .
This is used internally by the fetching service and should not normally be needed.
.It Nm "conf save\-defaults" Oo Ar file Oc
Prints default configuration parameters to standard output, or to
.Ar file
if specified.
Each parameter is annotated with a short description of its purpose and usage.
.El
.
.
.Sh USER METADATA
User metadata are primarily used by the Miniflux protocol,
and most properties have identical or similar names to those used by Miniflux.
Properties may also affect other protocols, or conversely may have no effect even when using the Miniflux protocol;
this is noted below when appropriate.
.Pp
Booleans accept any of the values
.Ar true Ns No / Ns Ar false Ns No ,
.Ar 1 Ns No / Ns Ar 0 Ns No ,
.Ar yes Ns No / Ns Ar no Ns No ,
or
.Ar on Ns No / Ns Ar off Ns No .
.Pp
The following metadata properties exist for each user:
.Pp
.Bl -tag
.It Cm num No (integer)
The numeric identifier of the user. 
This is assigned at user creation and is read-only.
.It Cm admin No (boolean)
Boolean. Whether the user is an administrator.
Administrators may manage other users via the Miniflux protocol,
and also may trigger feed updates manually via the Nextcloud News protocol.
.It Cm lang No (string)
The preferred language of the user as a BCP 47 language tag, for example "en-ca".
Note that since The Arsse currently only includes English text it is not used by The Arsse itself,
but clients may use this metadatum in protocols which expose it.
.It Cm tz No (string)
The time zone of the user as a Time Zone Database identifier, for example "America/Los_Angeles".
.It Cm root_folder_name No (string)
The name of the root folder, in protocols which allow it to be renamed.
.It Cm sort_asc No (boolean)
Whether the user prefers ascending sort order for articles.
Descending order is usually the default,
but explicitly setting this property false will also make a preference for descending order explicit.
.It Cm theme No (string)
The user's preferred user-interface theme.
This is not used by The Arsse itself, but clients may use this metadatum in protocols which expose it.
.It Cm page_size No (integer)
The user's preferred page size when listing articles.
This is not used by The Arsse itself, but clients may use this metadatum in protocols which expose it.
.It Cm shortcuts No (boolean)
Whether to enable keyboard shortcuts.
This is not used by The Arsse itself, but clients may use this metadatum in protocols which expose it.
.It Cm gestures No (boolean)
Whether to enable touch gestures.
This is not used by The Arsse itself, but clients may use this metadatum in protocols which expose it.
.It Cm reading_time No (boolean)
Whether to calculate and display the estimated reading time for articles.
Currently The Arsse does not calculate reading time, so changing this will likely have no effect.
.It Cm stylesheet No (string)
A user stylesheet in CSS format.
This is not used by The Arsse itself, but clients may use this metadatum in protocols which expose it.
